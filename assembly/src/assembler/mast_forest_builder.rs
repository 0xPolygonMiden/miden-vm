/// Determines if we want to merge a block with other blocks. Currently, this works as follows:
/// - If the block is a procedure, we merge it only if the number of operation batches is smaller
///   then the threshold (currently set at 32). The reasoning is based on an estimate of the the
///   runtime penalty of not inlining the procedure. We assume that this penalty is roughly 3 extra
///   nodes in the MAST and so would require 3 additional hashes at runtime. Since hashing each
///   operation batch requires 1 hash, this basically implies that if the runtime penalty is more
///   than 10%, we inline the block, but if it is less than 10% we accept the penalty to make
///   deserialization faster.
/// - If the block is not a procedure, we always merge it because: (1) if it is a large block, it is
///   likely to be unique and, thus, the original block will be orphaned and removed later; (2) if
///   it is a small block, there is a large run-time benefit for inlining it.
