// LINKER
// ================================================================================================

/// The [`Linker`] is responsible for analyzing the input modules and libraries provided to the
/// assembler, and _linking_ them together.
///
/// The core conceptual data structure of the linker is the _module graph_, which is implemented
/// by a vector of module nodes, and a _call graph_, which is implemented as an adjacency matrix
/// of procedure nodes and the outgoing edges from those nodes, representing references from that
/// procedure to another symbol (typically as the result of procedure invocation, hence "call"
/// graph).
///
/// Each procedure known to the linker is given a _global procedure index_, which is actually a
/// pair of indices: a _module index_ (which indexes into the vector of module nodes), and a
/// _procedure index_ (which indexes into the set of procedures defined by a module). These global
/// procedure indices function as a unique identifier within the linker, to a specific procedure,
/// and can be resolved to either the procedure AST, or to metadata about the procedure MAST.
///
/// The process of linking involves two phases:
///
/// 1. Setting up the linker context, by providing the set of libraries and/or input modules to link
/// 2. Analyzing and rewriting the module graph, as needed, to ensure that all procedure references
///    are resolved to either a concrete definition, or a "phantom" reference in the form of a MAST
///    root.
///
/// The assembler will call [`Self::link`] once it has provided all inputs that it wants to link,
/// which will, when successful, return the set of module indices corresponding to the modules that
/// comprise the public interface of the assembled artifact. The assembler then constructs the MAST
/// starting from the exported procedures of those modules, recursively tracing the call graph
/// based on whether or not the callee is statically or dynamically linked. In the static linking
/// case, any procedures referenced in a statically-linked library or module will be included in
/// the assembled artifact. In the dynamic linking case, referenced procedures are instead
/// referenced in the assembled artifact only by their MAST root.
