/// The underlying raw reader-writer primitive that implements [lock_api::RawRwLock]
///
/// This is fundamentally a spinlock, in that blocking operations on the lock will spin until
/// they succeed in acquiring/releasing the lock.
///
/// To achieve the ability to share the underlying data with multiple readers, or hold
/// exclusive access for one writer, the lock state is based on a "locked" count, where shared
/// access increments the count by an even number, and acquiring exclusive access relies on the
/// use of the lowest order bit to stop further shared acquisition, and indicate that the lock
/// is exclusively held (the difference between the two is irrelevant from the perspective of
/// a thread attempting to acquire the lock, but internally the state uses `usize::MAX` as the
/// "exclusively locked" sentinel).
///
/// This mechanism gets us the following:
///
/// * Whether the lock has been acquired (shared or exclusive)
/// * Whether the lock is being exclusively acquired
/// * How many times the lock has been acquired
/// * Whether the acquisition(s) are exclusive or shared
///
/// Further implementation details, such as how we manage draining readers once an attempt to
/// exclusively acquire the lock occurs, are described below.
///
/// NOTE: This is a simple implementation, meant for use in no-std environments; there are much
/// more robust/performant implementations available when OS primitives can be used.
