// SCANNER
// ================================================================================================

/// [Scanner] handles the low-level details of reading characters from a raw input stream of bytes.
/// It decodes those bytes into UTF-8 characters, and associates each character with the
/// [miden_core::debuginfo::ByteIndex] at which it occurs.
///
/// The [Scanner] is intended to be consumed by a lexer, which handles converting the stream of
/// characters into a token stream for use by the parser.
///
/// ## Scanner Lifecycle
///
/// The following illustrates how content flows from the raw input stream through the scanner.
///
/// ```ignore
/// lexer <- (peek) <- pending <- source
///       <- (pop) <- current <- pending <- source
/// ```
///
/// As shown above, the lexer is "pulling" characters from the scanner.
///
/// When "peeking" a character, we return the character currently in the `pending` field, but if
/// `pending` is empty, we read enough bytes from the source to construct a UTF-8 character, and
/// store it as `pending`, as well as returning it to the lexer.
///
/// When "popping" a character (i.e. we are advancing the scanner in the input), we are returning
/// the character in the `current` field, and then moving the character in `pending` into `current`.
/// Accordingly, if any of those fields is empty, we must pull from the next field in the chain,
/// reading bytes from the input as we go.
