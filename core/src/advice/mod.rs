// ADVICE PROVIDER
// ================================================================================================

/// Defines behavior of an advice provider.
///
/// An advice provider is a component through which the host can interact with the advice provider.
/// The host can request nondeterministic inputs from the advice provider (i.e., result of a
/// computation performed outside of the VM), as well as insert new data into the advice provider.
///
/// An advice provider consists of the following components:
/// 1. Advice stack, which is a LIFO data structure. The processor can move the elements from the
///    advice stack onto the operand stack, as well as push new elements onto the advice stack.
/// 2. Advice map, which is a key-value map where keys are words (4 field elements) and values are
///    vectors of field elements. The processor can push the values from the map onto the advice
///    stack, as well as insert new values into the map.
/// 3. Merkle store, which contains structured data reducible to Merkle paths. The VM can request
///    Merkle paths from the store, as well as mutate it by updating or merging nodes contained in
///    the store.
