## Cryptographic operations
Miden assembly provides a set of instructions for performing common cryptographic operations. These instructions are listed in the table below.

### Hashing and Merkle trees
[Rescue Prime Optimized](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1577) is the native hash function of Miden VM. The parameters of the hash function were chosen to provide 128-bit security level against preimage and collision attacks. The function operates over a state of 12 field elements, and requires 7 rounds for a single permutation. However, due to its special status within the VM, computing Rescue Prime Optimized hashes can be done very efficiently. For example, applying a permutation of the hash function can be done in a single VM cycle.

| mtree_get  <br> - *(9 cycles)*   | [d, i, R, ...]     | [V, R, ...]       | Fetches the node value from the advice provider and runs a verification equivalent to `mtree_verify`, returning the value if succeeded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Merkle tree with root $R$ must be present in the advice provider, otherwise execution fails. At the end of the operation the advice provider will contain both Merkle trees. |
| mtree_merge <br> - *(16 cycles)* | [R, L, ...]        | [M, ...]          | Merges two Merkle trees with the provided roots R (right), L (left) into a new Merkle tree with root M (merged). The input trees are retained in the advice provider.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| mtree_verify  <br> - *(1 cycle)* | [V, d, i, R, ...]  | [V, d, i, R, ...] | Verifies that a Merkle tree with root $R$ opens to node $V$ at depth $d$ and index $i$. Merkle tree with root $R$ must be present in the advice provider, otherwise execution fails. |

The `mtree_verify` instruction can also be parametrized with an error code which can be any 32-bit value specified either directly or via a [named constant](./code_organization.md#constants). For example:
```
mtree_verify.err=123
mtree_verify.err=MY_CONSTANT
```
If the error code is omitted, the default value of $0$ is assumed.
