# Unsigned 64-bit integer operations
Module `std::math::u64` contains a set of procedures which can be used to perform unsigned 64-bit integer operations. These operations fall into the following categories:

* **Arithmetic operations** - addition, multiplication, division etc.
* **Comparison operations** - equality, less than, greater than etc.
* **Bitwise operations** - binary AND, OR, XOR, bit shifts etc.

All procedures assume that an unsigned 64-bit integer (u64) is encoded using two elements, each containing an unsigned 32-bit integer (u32). When placed on the stack, the least-significant limb is assumed to be deeper in the stack. For example, a u64 value `a` consisting of limbs `a_hi` and `a_lo` would be position on the stack like so:
```
[a_hi, a_lo, ... ]
```

Many of the procedures listed below (e.g., `overflowing_add`, `wrapping_add`, `lt`) do not check whether the inputs are encoded using valid `u32` values. These procedures do not fail when the inputs are encoded incorrectly, but rather produce undefined results. Thus, it is important to be certain that limbs of input values are valid `u32` values prior to calling such procedures.
