#! Processes the public inputs.
#! 
#! This involves:
#!
#! 1. Loading from the advice stack the fixed-length public inputs and storing them in memory
#! starting from the address pointed to by `public_inputs_address_ptr`.
#! 2. Loading from the advice stack the variable-length public inputs, storing them temporarily
#! in memory, and then reducing them to an element in the challenge field using the auxiliary
#! randomness. This reduced value is then used to impose a boundary condition on the relevant
#! auxiliary column. 
#!
#! Note that the fixed length public inputs are stored as extension field elements while
#! the variable length ones are stored as base field elements.
#! Note also that, while loading the above, we compute the hash of the public inputs. The hashing
#! starts with capacity registers of the hash function set to `C` that is the result of hashing
#! the proof context.
#!
#! The output D, that is the digest of the above hashing, is then used in order to reseed
#! the random coin.
#!
#! It is worth noting that:
#!
#! 1. Only the fixed-length public inputs are stored for the lifetime of the verification procedure.
#!    The variable-length public inputs are stored temporarily, as this simplifies the task of
#!    reducing them using the auxiliary randomness. On the other hand, the resulting values from
#!    the aforementioned reductions are stored right after the fixed-length public inputs. These
#!    are stored in a word-aligned manner and padded with zeros if needed.
#! 2. The public inputs address is computed in such a way so as we end up with the following
#!    memory layout:
#!
#!    [..., a_0...a_{m-1}, b_0...b_{n-1}, alpha0, alpha1, beta0, beta1, OOD-evaluations-start, ...]
#!
#!    where:
#!
#!    1. [a_0...a_{m-1}] are the fixed-length public inputs stored as extension field elements. This
#!       section is double-word-aligned.
#!    2. [b_0...b_{n-1}] are the results of reducing the variable length public inputs using
#!       auxiliary randomness. This section is word-aligned.
#!    3. [alpha0, alpha1, beta0, beta1] is the auxiliary randomness.
#!    4. `OOD-evaluations-start` is the first field element of the section containing the OOD
#!       evaluations.
#! 3. Note that for each bus message in a group in the variable length public inputs, each
#!    message is expected to be padded to the next multiple of 8 and provided in reverse order.
#!    This has the benefit of making the reduction using the auxiliary randomness more efficient
#!    using `horner_eval_base`.

#! Reduces the variable-length public inputs using the auxiliary randomness.

#! The procedure non-deterministically loads the auxiliary randomness from the advice tape and

#! inputs to a single element in the challenge field. The resulting values are then stored
#! contiguously after the fixed-length public inputs.

#! Currently, the only variable-length public inputs are the kernel procedure digests.

#! Computes the address where the public inputs are to be stored and returns it.
#!
#! In order to be able to call `arithmetic_circuit_eval`, we need to layout the inputs to
#! the constraint evaluation circuit in a contiguous region of memory (called `READ` section
#! in the ACE chiplet documentation) right before the region of memory storing the circuit
#! description (called `EVAL` section in the ACE chiplet documentation).
#! As the number of public inputs is a per-instance parameter, while the sizes of the OOD
#! evaluation frames and the number of auxiliary random values are fixed, we can lay out
#! the public inputs right before the auxiliary random values and OOD evaluations.
#! Hence the address where public inputs are stored is computed using a negative offset
#! from the address where the OOD are stored.
#! We compute two pointers, one to the public inputs and the other is for the portion
#! within the public inputs region storing the variable length public inputs. This will be
#! the region storing, temporarily, the variable length public inputs that are to be reduced
#! by the auxiliary randomness and, permanently, the results of the aforementioned reductions.
