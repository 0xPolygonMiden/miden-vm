| Procedure | Description |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| verify | Verify a STARK proof attesting to the correct execution of a program in the Miden VM.<br /><br />The following simplifying assumptions are currently made:<br /><br />- The blowup is set to 8.<br /><br />- The maximal allowed degree of the remainder polynomial is 7.<br /><br />- Only the input and output stacks, assumed of fixed size equal to 16, are handled in regards<br /><br />to public inputs.<br /><br />- There are two trace segments, main and auxiliary. It is assumed that the main trace segment<br /><br />is 73 columns wide while the auxiliary trace segment is 9 columns wide.<br /><br />- The OOD evaluation frame is composed of two interleaved rows, current and next, each composed<br /><br />of 73 elements representing the main trace portion and 9 elements for the auxiliary trace one.<br /><br />- To boost soundness, the protocol is run on a quadratic extension field and this means that<br /><br />the OOD evaluation frame is composed of elements in a quadratic extension field i.e. tuples.<br /><br />Similarly, elements of the auxiliary trace are quadratic extension field elements.<br /><br />- The following procedure makes use of global memory address beyond 3 * 2^30 and these are<br /><br />defined in `constants.masm`.<br /><br />Input: [log(trace_length), num_queries, log(blowup), grinding]<br /><br />Output: []<br /><br />Cycles:<br /><br />1- Remainder codeword size 32:<br /><br />4683 + num_queries * (70 + num_fri_layers * 76 + 26 + 465) + 83 * num_fri_layers + 10 * log(trace_length) + 1498<br /><br />2- Remainder codeword size 64:<br /><br />4683 + num_queries * (70 + num_fri_layers * 76 + 26 + 465) + 83 * num_fri_layers + 10 * log(trace_length) + 2792 |
