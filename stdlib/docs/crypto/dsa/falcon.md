| Procedure | Description |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| hash_to_point | Takes as input a message digest, a nonce of size 40 bytes represented as 8 field elements<br /><br />and a pointer. The procedure absorbs MSG and NONCE into a fresh RPO state and squeezes the<br /><br />coefficients of a polynomial c representing the hash-to-point of (MSG \|\| NONCE). The coefficients<br /><br />are then saved in the memory region [c_ptr, c_ptr + 128).<br /><br />This implementation of the `hash_to_point` procedure avoids the rejection-sampling step<br /><br />required in the per-the-spec algorithm by using the observation on page 31 in<br /><br />https://falcon-sign.info/falcon.pdf<br /><br />Input: [c_ptr, MSG, NONCE1, NONCE0, ...]<br /><br />Output: [...]<br /><br />Cycles: 1884 |
| powers_of_tau | For an element `tau := (tau0, tau1)` in the quadratic extension field, computes all its powers<br /><br />`tau^i` for `i = 0,..., 512` and stores them in the memory region `[tau_ptr, tau_ptr + 513)`.<br /><br />The procedure returns `tau_ptr + 513`.<br /><br />Input: [tau1, tau0, tau_ptr, ...]<br /><br />Output: [tau_ptr + 513, ...]<br /><br />Cycles: 8323 |
| set_to_zero | Sets the memory region `[ptr, ptr + 512)` to zero. The pointer c_ptr := ptr + 512 is returned<br /><br />to be used to store the hash-to-point polynomial of the message later on.<br /><br />Input: [ptr, ...]<br /><br />Output: [...]<br /><br />Cycles: 2607 |
| load_h_s2_and_product | Takes as input PK, the hash of the coefficients of the polynomial `h` representing the expanded<br /><br />public key, and a pointer to the memory location where the coefficients of the polynomial `h`<br /><br />will be stored.<br /><br />The procedure loads `h` from the advice stack and compares its hash with the provided hash `PK`.<br /><br />It then loads the polynomial `s2` representing the signature from the advice stack and lays it<br /><br />in memory right after `h`.<br /><br />It then loads the claimed polynomial `h * s2` in Z_Q[x] where Q is the Miden VM prime from<br /><br />the advice stack and lays it right after `s2`.<br /><br />The hash of `h`, `s2` and the claimed product is also computed and the first two field elements<br /><br />of the digest (i.e., the Fiat-Shamir challenge) are returned on the stack alongside<br /><br />the incremented pointer.<br /><br />Input: [ptr, PK, ...]<br /><br />Output: [tau1, tau0, ptr + 512 ...]<br /><br />Cycles: 570 |
| assert_lt_12289 | Given a pointer to the coefficients of a polynomial, the following procedure checks that<br /><br />the coefficients are less than the Falcon modulus q = 12289. This check is necessary for<br /><br />the soundness of the probablistic product check. As part of Falcon signature, one of the polynomials<br /><br />(i.e. s2) undergoes a squared norm check which fails if any of the coefficients is larger than<br /><br />12289, hence we need to apply the range check `assert_lt_12289` only to the other polynomial<br /><br />(i.e. h).<br /><br />Input: [ptr, ...]<br /><br />Output: [...]<br /><br />Cycles: 5249 |
| probablistic_product | Checks that pi == h * s2 in Z_Q[x] by evaluating both sides at a random point.<br /><br />The procedure takes as input a pointer h_ptr to h. The other two polynomials<br /><br />are located at h_ptr + 128, for s2, and h_ptr + 256, for pi. The procedure takes<br /><br />also a pointer zeros_ptr to a region of memory [zeros_ptr, zeros_ptr + 1024)<br /><br />and a pointer tau_ptr to powers of the random point we are evaluating at stored<br /><br />as [a_i, b_i, x, x] where (a_i, b_i) := tau^i for i in [0, 1023].<br /><br />The procedure returns () if the check passes, otherwise it raises an exception<br /><br />related to an unsatisfied assertion.<br /><br />Input: [h_ptr, zeros_ptr, tau_ptr, ...]<br /><br />Output: [...]<br /><br />Cycles: 7753 |
| norm_sq | Normalizes an `e` in [0, q) to be in [-(q-1) << 1, (q-1) << 1) and returns its square norm.<br /><br />We use the following formula to do so:<br /><br />normalize(e) = e^2 - phi * (2*q*e - q^2) where phi := (e > (q - 1)/2)<br /><br />The formula implements:<br /><br />if e > (q-1)/2:<br /><br />return (q - e)^2<br /><br />else:<br /><br />return e^2<br /><br />The use of the formula avoids using the if-else block.<br /><br />Input: [e, ...]<br /><br />Output [norm(e)^2, ...]<br /><br />Cycles: 21 |
| diff_mod_q | On input a tuple (u, w, v), the following computes (v - (u + (- w % q) % q) % q).<br /><br />We can avoid doing three modular reductions by using the following facts:<br /><br />1. q is much smaller than the Miden prime. Precisely, q * 2^50 < Q<br /><br />2. The coefficients of the product polynomial, u and w, are less than J := 512 * q^2<br /><br />3. The coefficients of c are less than q.<br /><br />This means that we can substitute (v - (u + (- w % q) % q) % q) with  v + w + J - u without<br /><br />risking overflow since \|v + w + J - u\| < 1025 * q^2<br /><br />To get the final result we reduce (v + w + J - u) modulo q.<br /><br />Input: [v, w, u, ...]<br /><br />Output: [e, ...]<br /><br />Cycles: 44 |
| compute_s1_norm_sq | Takes a pointer to a polynomial pi of degree less than 1024 with coefficients in Z_Q and<br /><br />a polynomial c of degree 512 with coefficients also in Z_Q, where Q is the Miden prime.<br /><br />The goal is to compute s1 = c - pi  = c - h * s2 in Z_q[x]/(phi) where q is the Falcon prime.<br /><br />The pointer pi_ptr points both to pi and c through the relation c_ptr = pi_ptr + offset<br /><br />where offset := 1281.<br /><br />The naive way to compute s1 would be to first reduce the polynomial pi modulo the Falcon<br /><br />prime q and then modulo the irreducible polynomial phi = x^512 + 1. Then we would need to negate<br /><br />the coefficients of pi modulo q and only then can we add these coefficients to the coefficients<br /><br />of c and then reduce the result modulo q one more time.<br /><br />Knowing that the end goal of computing c is to compute its norm squared, we can do better.<br /><br />We can compute s1 in a single pass by delaying the q-modular reduction til the end. This can<br /><br />be achieved through a careful analysis of the computation of the difference between pi and c.<br /><br />The i-th coefficient s1_i of s1 is equal to c_i - (pi_i - pi_{512 + i}) which is equal to<br /><br />c_i  + pi_{512 + i} - pi_i. Now, we know that the size of the pi_i coefficients is bounded by<br /><br />J := 512 * q^2 and this means that J + pi_{512 + i} - pi_i does not Q-underflow and since<br /><br />J = 0 modulo q, the addition of J does not affect the final result. It is also important to<br /><br />note that adding J does not Q-overflow by virtue of q * 2^50 < Q.<br /><br />All of the above implies that we can compute s1_i with only one modular reduction at the end,<br /><br />in addition to one modular reduction applied to c_i.<br /><br />Moreover, since we are only interested in the square norm of s1_i, we do not have to store<br /><br />s1_i and then load it at a later point, and instead we can immediatly follow the computation<br /><br />of s1_i with computing its square norm.<br /><br />After computing the square norm of s1_i, we can accumulate into an accumulator to compute the<br /><br />sum of the square norms of all the coefficients of polynomial c. Using the overflow stack, this<br /><br />can be delayed til the end.<br /><br />Input: [pi_ptr, ...]<br /><br />Output: [norm_sq(s1), ...]<br /><br />Cycles: 58888 |
| compute_s2_norm_sq | Compute the square norm of the polynomial s2 given a pointer to its coefficients.<br /><br />Input: [s2_ptr, ...]<br /><br />Output: [norm_sq(s2), ...]<br /><br />Cycles: 13322 |
| verify | Verifies a signature against a public key and a message. The procedure gets as inputs the hash<br /><br />of the public key and the hash of the message via the operand stack. The signature is provided<br /><br />via the advice stack.<br /><br />The signature is valid if and only if the procedure returns.<br /><br />Input: [PK, MSG, ...]<br /><br />Output: [...]<br /><br />Cycles: ~ 93363 |
