// CONSTANTS
// ================================================================================================

/// Number of columns needed to record an execution trace of the memory chiplet.
pub const TRACE_WIDTH: usize = 15;

// --- OPERATION SELECTORS ------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// Specifies the value of the `READ_WRITE` column when the operation is a write.
pub const MEMORY_WRITE: Felt = ZERO;
/// Specifies the value of the `READ_WRITE` column when the operation is a read.
pub const MEMORY_READ: Felt = ONE;

// --- BUS LABELS ------------------------------------------------------------------------

// All bus labels encode the chiplet selector (1, 1, 0), as well as the read/write and element/word
// columns. The purpose of the label is to force the chiplet to assign the correct values to the
// read/write and element/word columns. We also include the chiplet selector as a unique identifier
// for memory chiplet labels (to ensure they don't collide with labels from other chiplets).
