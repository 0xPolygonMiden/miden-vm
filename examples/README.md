# Examples
This crate contains several examples of Miden VM programs and demonstrates how these programs can be executed on Miden VM.

## Running examples
To run examples of executing programs and verifying proofs of their execution, do the following:

First, compile an optimized version of the `miden` binary by running:
```
cargo build --release
```
Or, if you want to compile the with multi-threaded support enabled, run:
```
cargo build --release --manifest-path examples/Cargo.toml --features concurrent
```

In either case, the binary will be located in `target/release` directory, and you can run it like so:
```
./target/release/miden [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>
```
Where each example can be invoked using a distinct subcommand. To view the list of all available options and examples you can look up help like so:

```
./target/release/miden -h
```
This will print out something similar to this:
```
Miden 0.1.0
Miden examples

USAGE:
    miden.exe [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -s, --security <security>    Security level for execution proofs generated by the VM [default: 96bits]

SUBCOMMANDS:
    collatz        Compute a Collatz sequence from the specified starting value
    comparison     If provided value is less than 9, multiplies it by 9; otherwise add 9 to it
    conditional    If provided value is 0, outputs 15; if provided value is 1, outputs 8
    fib            Compute a Fibonacci sequence of the specified length
    help           Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    merkle         Computes a root of a randomly generated Merkle branch of the specified depth
    range          Determines how many of the randomly generated values are less than 2^63
```

Currently, the only available option for all examples is `-s` for specifying security level for the generated proofs. This can be set to one of two values:
* *96bits* - for 96-bit security level (the default).
* *128bits* - for 128-bit security level.

For example, to execute Fibonacci calculator at 128-bit security level, you can run the following:
```
./target/release/miden -s 128bits fib
```

### Example-specific options

To view additional options available for specific examples, you can run the following:
```
./target/release/miden help <example name>
```
For example, executing:
```
./target/release/miden help collatz
```
Will print something like this:
```
miden.exe-collatz 0.1.0
Compute a Collatz sequence from the specified starting value

USAGE:
    miden.exe collatz [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -n <start-value>        Starting value of the Collatz sequence [default: 511]
```

Thus, to compute Collatz sequence with a different starting value, you could execute something like this:
```
./target/release/miden collatz -n 513
```
