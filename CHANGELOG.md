- [BREAKING] Reordered the output stack for Miden assembly cryptographic operations `mtree_set` and `mtree_get` to improve efficiency.
- Refactored the advice provider to add support for advice maps, and added the `adv.mem` decorator for copying memory regions into the advice map.
- [BREAKING] Refactored the Assembler and added support for module providers. (Standard library is no longer available by default.)
